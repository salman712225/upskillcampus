## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting agricultural crop production in India using machine learning techniques.  
The dataset (2001–2014) was sourced from [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/) and contains information about crop type, state, season, cost of cultivation, and production.

## 🛠️ Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Crop patterns across states and seasons  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Cost-per-ton, production-per-hectare  
4. **Modeling** – Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting  
5. **Evaluation** – R² and RMSE scores, with Random Forest achieving best accuracy (R² ~ 0.87)  
6. **Explainability** – SHAP values used to interpret feature importance

## 📊 Results
- Random Forest Regressor: **R² = 0.87** (best model)  
- Gradient Boosting: R² = 0.85  
- Linear Regression: R² = 0.72  
- Key predictors: Cost of cultivation, state, crop type

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Add weather & soil datasets for better predictions  
- Deploy a real-time dashboard with Streamlit  
- Integrate with government portals for policy support
